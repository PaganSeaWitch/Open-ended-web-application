# Solitare Clock
Solitare clock or clock solitare is a version of solitare where the user has only 1 option per turn. I decided to automate that and put onto the internet. Currently, its client side scripting but I am going to change that to server side so that everyone can view the same solitare clock on the website.

# WHY THO?
Its my life, leave me alone.

A version of agnes solitare that only exists on the GNUGames AisleRiot solitare application. [More Info on AisleRiot Agnes Solitare](https://help.gnome.org/users/aisleriot/stable/Agnes.html.en)

# WHY THO?
WHY? I don't fucking know, and if I had known this was a unique version I wouldn't have made it.
